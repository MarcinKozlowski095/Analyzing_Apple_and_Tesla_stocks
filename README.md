The dataset contains daily stock prices of two companies, Apple and Tesla, from February 22, 2022, to February 17, 2023. The stock prices are presented in the Open, High, Low, Close, and Adjusted Close columns, along with the corresponding volumes of shares traded.

The goal of this capstone project is to provide you with hands-on experience in working with real-world data by performing various data analysis tasks using Python. You will use Pandas, a popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis, to read the data from a CSV file, answer basic statistical questions, create new columns, rename columns, drop and create new rows, filter the data to answer questions, and create basic plots.
